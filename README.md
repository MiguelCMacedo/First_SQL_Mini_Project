Hi dear reader,

This is my first very little SQL project, with a practice focus. I used a CSV type file wich contains a record of sales from an online store. You can find 
the project on the same repository of this one. 

I used different functions, but I tried to use mostly CTEs, Create some Views when I thougth it make sense to reference that output later. I also used a lot of 
Window Aggregation Functions, and a few of Rank ones.
Of course the data needed a little cleaning, nothing special but to show a little of my data cleaning skills. 

Along the project I make a description of almost every decision and what's the reason for it. 

If you're going to take a look at the file, please don't hesitate on giving me feedback, I'm always open to improve.
